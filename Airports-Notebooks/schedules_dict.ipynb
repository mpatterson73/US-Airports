Format is months/days/hours where the first part describes the months that the facility is attended, then the days of the week that the facility is open, and finally the hours within the day that it is attended.

If there are different schedules for different times of the year or different days of the week there will be separate records for each set of monts, days, and hours of attendance.  (ex.
