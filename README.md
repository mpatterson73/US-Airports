### FAA Airport Data

I downloaded the current [FAA airport data](https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/airportdata_5010/#importers) and I'm preprocessing it using pandas. 

I've cleansed and organized the data, by dropping, renaming columns and the data within. The newdata is written to csv files. The Data descriptions written to an exel file.

Next I plan to load the data into a relational database and/or mongodb. 

Finally I want to design a REST api for accessing the data.
